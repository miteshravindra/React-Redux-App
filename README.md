# React-Redux-App
Building a single page application using reactjs and redux architecture.
I am using webpack as a module bundler instead of browserify and npm scripts instead of gulp.
Since the application is in ES6 I am using babel to transpile ES6 to ES5 which is supported by the browser and also added some polyfills to supported
ES6 features
